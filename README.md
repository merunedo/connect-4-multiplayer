# Connect 4 Multiplayer Game

Welcome to the Connect 4 Multiplayer Game project! This document (README.md) serves as a guide and overview for anyone interested in the project. It includes the project plan, technology stack, development steps, and how to contribute.

## Project Overview
This is a web-based Connect 4 game that enables two players to play with each other in real-time from different locations. The game is designed to be responsive so that players can enjoy it on both desktop and mobile browsers.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - *HTML* for the structure of the web pages.
  - *CSS* for styling and making the game look attractive.
  - *JavaScript* for the interactive elements of the game.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
  - *Node.js* for the server-side logic.
  - *Express* for setting up the web server and handling requests.
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO
  - *Socket.IO* for enabling real-time bidirectional event-based communication.
- **Deployment**: Heroku, GitHub Pages
  - *Heroku* for hosting the backend.
  - *GitHub Pages* for hosting the frontend static files.

## Development Plan
The project is divided into two main phases: setting up and implementing the core mechanics, and then adding multiplayer functionality and final touches.

### Week 1: Setup and Basic Game Mechanics
- Day 1-3: Prepare the project structure and start with the frontend development.
- Day 4-5: Code the game logic including how players take turns, drop chips, and determine the winner.
- Day 6-7: Begin backend development to manage game sessions.

### Week 2: Multiplayer Functionality and Polishing
- Day 8-10: Work on integrating Socket.IO for real-time gameplay.
- Day 11-12: Set up multiplayer lobbies and handle game state synchronization.
- Day 13: Perform thorough testing across different devices to ensure compatibility.
- Day 14: Deploy the application and perform final checks.

## Testing & Debugging
We will test the application at each stage of development to catch and fix bugs early. This includes:
- Manual testing during development to ensure each feature works as intended.
- Cross-browser testing to make sure the game runs smoothly on various web browsers.
- Usability testing to improve the player experience.

## Deployment
The game will be deployed in two parts:
- The backend will be hosted on Heroku, which provides a free tier for small projects.
- The frontend will be on GitHub Pages, which allows hosting of static web pages directly from a GitHub repository.

## Post-Launch
After launching the game, we will:
- Monitor the game's performance and user feedback.
- Make improvements and fix any emerging issues.
- Consider adding more features based on player requests.
